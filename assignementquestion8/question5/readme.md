The main difference between class-based and function-based components in React lies in their syntax and capabilities. Here's a breakdown of the key differences:

Syntax: Class-based components are defined as ES6 classes that extend the React.Component base class. They use the render() method to return JSX elements. On the other hand, function-based components are defined as JavaScript functions that return JSX directly.

State and Lifecycle Methods: Class-based components have their own internal state managed through the this.state object. They can use lifecycle methods like componentDidMount(), componentDidUpdate(), and componentWillUnmount() to handle component initialization, state updates, and clean-up operations. Function-based components, in their traditional form, do not have their own state or lifecycle methods. However, with the introduction of React Hooks, function components can now use state and lifecycle features by utilizing hooks like useState, useEffect, and useContext.

Readability and Simplicity: Function-based components are generally considered simpler and more concise. They involve writing fewer lines of code and do not require understanding the concept of this and binding event handlers. They are often preferred for simple, stateless UI components.

Performance: Function-based components are usually more performant due to being lightweight and not requiring the overhead of creating a class instance. They can leverage React's memoization and optimization techniques like React.memo to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

Error Boundaries and Refs: Class-based components can define error boundaries using the componentDidCatch() lifecycle method to catch and handle errors within their component tree. They can also use refs to access and manipulate DOM elements directly. Function-based components, in their traditional form, do not support these features. However, with React Hooks, error boundaries can be created using the ErrorBoundary component, and refs can be used with the useRef hook.
