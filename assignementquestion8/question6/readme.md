React component lifecycle refers to the series of phases or stages that a React component goes through during its existence, from creation to removal. Each phase in the lifecycle provides an opportunity to perform certain actions and handle specific events. The React component lifecycle can be divided into three main phases: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting.

Mounting Phase:

constructor(): This is the first method called when a component is being created. It is used to initialize the component's state and bind event handlers.
static getDerivedStateFromProps(): This method is called right before rendering and allows the component to update its state based on the changes in props.
render(): This method is responsible for returning the JSX representation of the component's UI. It is a required method in every component.
componentDidMount(): This method is invoked immediately after the component is mounted in the DOM. It is commonly used for side effects such as fetching data from an API or subscribing to events.
Updating Phase:

static getDerivedStateFromProps(): This method is also called during the updating phase and allows the component to update its state based on changes in props.
shouldComponentUpdate(): This method determines whether the component should re-render or not. It can be used to optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders.
render(): The render method is called again to update the UI based on the new props or state.
getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(): This method is called just before the changes from the virtual DOM are reflected in the actual DOM. It allows components to capture information from the DOM before it is potentially changed.
componentDidUpdate(): This method is invoked after the component is re-rendered. It is commonly used for side effects such as updating the DOM, making additional API calls, or updating the component's state.
Unmounting Phase:

componentWillUnmount(): This method is called right before a component is unmounted and removed from the DOM. It is used for performing any necessary cleanup tasks such as canceling timers, removing event listeners, or clearing subscriptions.
