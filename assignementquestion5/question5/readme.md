Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to other functions. They are commonly used in JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations and ensure that code executes in the correct order.

In the context of asynchronous programming, a callback function is invoked once an asynchronous operation completes or encounters an error. It allows you to continue executing code that depends on the result of the asynchronous operation. Callbacks are essential for handling events, making HTTP requests, working with timers, and performing other non-blocking operations.

Callback Hell refers to a situation where code with multiple asynchronous operations and callbacks becomes deeply nested and difficult to read and maintain. It occurs when callbacks are used for sequential or dependent operations, leading to a pyramid-shaped structure of callbacks.

Callback Hell can be mitigated using techniques like named functions, modularization, or adopting other asynchronous patterns like Promises or async/await. These patterns provide more structured and readable ways to handle asynchronous operations, allowing for better code organization and error handling
