setTimeout and setInterval are two JavaScript functions used to schedule the execution of code after a specified delay or at regular intervals. They are commonly used for implementing timers, animations, periodic updates, and other time-related operations in web applications.

setTimeout:
The setTimeout function is used to execute a specific block of code or a function after a specified delay (in milliseconds). It takes two parameters: the callback function to be executed and the delay duration.

syntax : 
setTimeout(callback, delay);

setInterval:
The setInterval function is used to repeatedly execute a specific block of code or a function at a specified interval. It takes two parameters: the callback function to be executed and the interval duration (in milliseconds).

syntax:
setInterval(callback, interval);


Both setTimeout and setInterval return a unique identifier (an integer value) that can be used to cancel or stop the scheduled execution using the clearTimeout and clearInterval functions, respectively.
