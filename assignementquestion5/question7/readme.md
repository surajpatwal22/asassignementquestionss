The async and await keywords are part of the JavaScript language and provide a more readable and synchronous-like way to write asynchronous code. They are used together to simplify the handling of promises and make asynchronous code appear more sequential and easier to understand.

Here's an overview of async and await:

async: The async keyword is used to declare an asynchronous function. It allows the function to use the await keyword inside its body. An async function always returns a promise.

await: The await keyword can only be used inside an async function. It pauses the execution of the function until a promise is fulfilled or resolved. It "awaits" the result of the promise and then continues with the execution.

The await keyword can only be used with expressions that return promises, including native promises and functions that return promises.

By using async and await, asynchronous code can be written in a more linear and sequential style, similar to synchronous code. This makes it easier to read, write, and reason about asynchronous operations, especially when dealing with multiple asynchronous calls or complex control flows.

Error handling with async/await can be done using try-catch blocks. If an awaited promise is rejected, an exception is thrown, and the catch block can handle the error.

Using async/await can make asynchronous code more concise, maintainable, and less prone to callback hell or deeply nested code structures. However, it's important to note that async/await is just a syntactic sugar on top of promises and is not suitable for all situations. It is recommended to have a good understanding of promises and their behavior before using async/await.
