In JavaScript, the call, apply, and bind methods are used to manipulate the value of this in a function and to invoke functions with a specific context. Here's an explanation of each method and the differences between them:

call method: The call method allows you to invoke a function with a specified this value and any number of additional arguments passed individually. It takes the this value as the first argument and the remaining arguments are passed comma-separated.

apply method: Similar to the call method, the apply method invokes a function with a specified this value and accepts an array-like object or an array of arguments. The this value is passed as the first argument, and the arguments are provided as an array or an array-like object as the second argument.

bind method: The bind method returns a new function with a specified this value, but it doesn't immediately invoke the function. Instead, it creates a bound function that can be invoked later. The bind method takes the this value as the first argument, followed by any additional arguments.

call and apply methods immediately invoke the function, while bind returns a new function.
call method accepts arguments individually, while apply accepts arguments as an array or an array-like object.
bind method allows you to create a new function with a specific this value that can be invoked later.
