In JavaScript, a constructor is a special method used for creating and initializing objects that are instances of a class or a blueprint. It is invoked when an object is created using the new keyword. The purpose of a constructor is to set up the initial state or properties of the object being created.

The constructor function typically has the same name as the class it belongs to and is defined using the function keyword. When the constructor is called with the new keyword, it creates a new instance of the class and initializes its properties.

The purpose of a constructor is to ensure that the newly created object has the required initial state. It allows us to set up the object's properties, perform any necessary setup or initialization tasks, and define the behavior specific to that object.

Constructors can also define methods and perform additional actions during the object creation process. They are commonly used to initialize instance variables, establish default values, set up event listeners, create closures, or perform any other necessary setup specific to the object being instantiated.
