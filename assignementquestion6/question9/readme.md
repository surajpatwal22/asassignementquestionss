In JavaScript, a class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure, behavior, and attributes of objects. It serves as a blueprint for creating multiple objects with the same structure and behavior. Classes provide a way to organize and encapsulate related data and functionality into a reusable entity.

Introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6), JavaScript classes are syntactic sugar over the existing prototype-based inheritance model. They provide a more familiar syntax for defining and working with objects, similar to class-based languages.

JavaScript classes also support inheritance, allowing you to create subclasses that inherit properties and methods from a parent class using the extends keyword. This enables code reuse and facilitates the creation of more specialized objects.

It's important to note that JavaScript classes are still based on prototypes under the hood. The class syntax provides a more intuitive and structured way of working with objects
