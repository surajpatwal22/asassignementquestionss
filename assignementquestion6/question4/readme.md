OOPS (Object-Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm that focuses on organizing code into objects, which are instances of classes or blueprints. It provides a way to structure and model software systems based on real-world entities, making it easier to design, develop, and maintain complex applications.

The key concepts in OOPS are:

Classes: A class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure, behavior, and attributes of objects. It encapsulates data (properties) and functions (methods) that operate on that data. It serves as a blueprint from which objects are created.

Objects: Objects are instances of classes. They represent specific entities or things with their own state (data/properties) and behavior (methods). Objects can interact with each other through their methods and can have relationships, such as inheritance and composition.

Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the principle of bundling data and related methods into a single unit (class) and hiding the internal details from the outside. It provides data protection and ensures that data can be accessed and modified only through defined methods, allowing for better data integrity and security.

Inheritance: Inheritance allows classes to inherit properties and methods from other classes, forming a hierarchical relationship. It promotes code reusability by allowing new classes to inherit and extend the functionality of existing classes. Inheritance supports the "is-a" relationship, where a subclass is a specialized version of a superclass.

Polymorphism: Polymorphism refers to the ability of objects to take on different forms or behaviors based on the context. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, enabling code to be written that can work with objects of different types. Polymorphism promotes code flexibility and extensibility.

Abstraction: Abstraction focuses on representing the essential features of an object or system while hiding unnecessary details. It allows developers to create abstract classes or interfaces that define common behaviors without specifying the implementation details. Abstraction helps in managing complexity, improving code maintainability, and facilitating modular design.

Association and Composition: Association represents a relationship between two or more objects, where each object maintains its own identity. Composition is a stronger form of association, where one object contains another object as part of its own structure. These relationships allow objects to interact and collaborate to perform complex tasks.

OOPS promotes the concepts of modularity, reusability, maintainability, and extensibility in software development
